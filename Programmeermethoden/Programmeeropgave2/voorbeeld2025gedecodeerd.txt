Fello darkness, my old friend
G've come to talk with you again
@ecause a vision softly creeping
Jeft its seeds while I was sleeping
?nd the vision that was planted in my brain
Qtill remains
Uithin the sound of silence
7876
Kn restless dreams I walked alone
Parrow streets of cobblestone
0.. met twee tabs		die je over moet slaan
Cnd touched the sound of silence
396
Ald the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
Ald tenement halls
