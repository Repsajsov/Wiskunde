Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
9876
Qn restless dreams I alked alone
Narro streets of cobblestone
... met tee tabs		die je over moet slaan
And touched the sound of silence
